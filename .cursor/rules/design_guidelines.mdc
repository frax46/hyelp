# Design Guidelines

When suggesting design or styling changes:

- **Styling**: Use Tailwind utility classes for consistency and responsiveness.
- **Animations**: Implement GSAP for smooth, performant animations and transitions.
- **Images**:
  - Apply SVG masks to create unique, eye-catching effects.
  - Use high-quality placeholders from Pixabay, Unsplash, or Pexels.
- **Depth**: Add depth with shadows, layering, or subtle parallax effects.
- **Contrast**: Ensure high contrast (at least 4.5:1 for text) for readability. Test with tools like WebAIM.
- **Gestalt Theory**:
  - Group similar items (Law of Similarity).
  - Place related items close together (Law of Proximity).
- **Spacing**: Use generous margins and padding to avoid clutter.
- **Design System**: Follow the project's design system for colors, typography, and components.
- **Typography**:
  - For large headings (e.g., 2rem+), use tighter line height (1.2–1.3).
  - For body text (e.g., 1rem), use larger line height (1.5–1.6).
  - Establish clear hierarchy with font sizes, weights, and colors.
- **Color Scheme**: Choose a harmonious, accessible palette. Test for contrast.

Always consider these principles to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and accessible design.
