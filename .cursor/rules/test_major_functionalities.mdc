# Testing Major Functionalities

After generating or modifying code in response to a prompt:

- Suggest writing unit tests for new functions or methods using the project's testing framework (e.g., Jest).
- Recommend updating existing tests if the changes affect them.
- For critical paths, suggest writing integration tests.
- Remind the user to run the test suite (e.g., `npm test`) to verify the changes.

If applicable, refer to existing tests in @file tests/ and follow the guidelines in @file TESTING.md.
